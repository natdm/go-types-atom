# go-types

Go Types View adds a list of all types in the currently active file in a panel to the left of the screen. The panel is updated after each save, and has click-to-navigate functionality.

- Click `By Line` (default) to sort entries by line
- Click `By Method` to group types with their method, overriding line numbers.
- Click a method, type, or declaration to navigate to that declaration.

Toggle open/close with `option-ctrl-o` (unless there's something else with that, then open with `cmd + shift + p` and search `go types` to toggle)

Being a newly published package, it's not bullet-proof yet. If you have any issues, I welcome Github issues and will fix it as soon as I can. Typically the following day.

Also keep an eye out for updates.
